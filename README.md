# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Efficiency- Helps optimize workflow as well as maintaining high quality standards
Security- Helps in protecting user information by ensuring encryption, authentication and authorization
Flexibility- Ensures that the system is able to handle more workload without affecting performance

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- Involves defining the software's scope and purpose.
Requirements Analysis- Identifies and records the precise requirements of the final user.
Design-Involves building the framework, it outlines the software's functionality and aesthetic.
Coding- Involves converting the software design into tangible code.
Software testing- Involves thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that occur during coding. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
